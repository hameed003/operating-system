Yes! **Logical cores are somewhat similar to virtualization, but they work at the CPU level instead of the OS level.**

### **ðŸ”¹ Similarities Between Logical Cores and Virtualization:**

1. **Both create virtual units from physical hardware:**

   - **Logical cores**: A physical core is split into multiple **logical cores** (via Hyper-Threading).
   - **Virtualization**: A single physical machine is split into multiple **virtual machines (VMs)**.

2. **Both improve resource utilization:**
   - **Logical cores** allow better CPU efficiency by handling multiple threads per core.
   - **Virtualization** allows multiple OS instances to run on the same hardware.

### **ðŸ”¹ Key Difference:**

| Feature                | Logical Cores                                                           | Virtualization (VMware, VirtualBox)                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**       | Divides a physical CPU core into **multiple logical cores**.            | Divides a **whole computer** into multiple virtual machines (VMs).          |
| **Level of operation** | Works at the **CPU level**.                                             | Works at the **system level**.                                              |
| **Main technology**    | Uses **Hyper-Threading (HT)** or **Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)**. | Uses a **Hypervisor** (like VMware, VirtualBox, KVM).                       |
| **Example**            | A 4-core CPU with HT appears as **8 logical cores**.                    | A single PC can run **multiple operating systems (Windows + Linux, etc.)**. |

### **ðŸ”¹ Final Answer:**

âœ… **Logical cores â‰ˆ virtualization, but only for CPU processing power.**  
âœ… **VMware/VirtualBox virtualizes entire machines, not just the CPU.**

Would you like an analogy to make it clearer? ðŸ˜Š

# Doubt:

consider a hypothothetical scenario where there is a `system/machine` which contains `4 physical cores` and `8 logiacal cores` and three is no process running on it currently and if i run a `program/softwar` which contains only `one process ( main thread )` and no `child process` or `sub process` ( means other threads ), so will there be used only `one logical core`.
