Yes, exactly! **Threads are not physically present in the core; they are created when a program runs.**

### 🔹 **How It Works:**

- A **CPU core** is a physical processing unit.
- When an application runs, it creates **one or more threads** to execute tasks.
- The **CPU schedules these threads** to run on available cores.
- If the CPU supports **Hyper-Threading (HT)**, each core can handle **two threads at the same time**.

### 🔹 **Example:**

- Suppose you have a **quad-core CPU with HT (4 cores, 8 threads).**
- If you open **a browser, a music player, and a game**, each may create multiple threads.
- The CPU **assigns these threads** to logical cores for execution.

### **Key Takeaway:**

✅ **Threads are created dynamically when software runs; they don’t physically exist in the core.**  
✅ **A core can process multiple threads using scheduling and Hyper-Threading.**

# Doubt:

so that means the threds are not executed by the `phsical core` but it is executed by the `logcal cores`. [Ans-5](https://github.com/hameed003/operating-system/blob/main/Processor-Core-Thread/solutons/Ans-5.md)
