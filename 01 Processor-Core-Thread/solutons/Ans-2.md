Not exactly! Let's analyze each statement carefully:

1. **Statement 1: "1 core contains two logical cores."**

   - This is incorrect wording. A **core** is a physical processing unit, but it does not contain "logical cores."
   - Instead, if **Hyper-Threading (HT)** is enabled, **one core can handle two threads**, making it appear as **two logical processors** to the OS.

2. **Statement 2: "1 core contains 2 threads."**

   - This is **correct** (for CPUs with Hyper-Threading or Simultaneous Multithreading).
   - Each core can handle **two threads**, meaning it can execute **two tasks simultaneously**.

3. **Statement 3: "1 core can handle 2 threads."**
   - This is also **correct** and is another way of stating Statement 2.
   - A core does not "contain" threads, but it can **process** two threads at the same time.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Statement 1 is incorrect** due to misleading terminology ("logical cores").
- **Statements 2 and 3 are correct** and mean the same thing, just phrased differently.

`2 logical cores` and `2 thread` are they both same thing? [Ans-3](https://github.com/hameed003/operating-system/blob/main/Processor-Core-Thread/solutons/Ans-3.md)
