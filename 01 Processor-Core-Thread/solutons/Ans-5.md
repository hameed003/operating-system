Yes! **Threads are executed by logical cores, not directly by physical cores.**

### ðŸ”¹ **Breaking It Down:**

- A **physical core** is the actual hardware unit inside the CPU.
- A **logical core** is a **virtual processing unit** created by technologies like **Hyper-Threading (HT)**.
- The **operating system assigns threads to logical cores**, and the logical cores handle execution.

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

âœ… If a CPU has **4 physical cores without HT**, it has **4 logical cores** â†’ Executes **4 threads at a time**.  
âœ… If a CPU has **4 physical cores with HT**, it has **8 logical cores** â†’ Executes **8 threads at a time**.  
âœ… A **logical core** is what actually **executes the thread**, even though it's based on the **physical core's resources**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Final Answer:**

âœ… **Threads are executed by logical cores, which use the resources of physical cores.**  
âœ… **A physical core supports multiple logical cores, allowing more threads to run efficiently.**

# Doubt:

since you said the logical cores are created by `technologies like `Hyper-Threading (HT)`so if`processor` does not support`HT`, so how it can even contain `4 logical cores`for`4 physical core`, should it not only contain `4 physical core` ?
