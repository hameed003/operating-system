Unfortunately, I cannot directly create or draw visual diagrams or PDFs. However, I can provide you with a **detailed textual representation** of the concepts we've discussed, which you can use to create your own diagrams or visualizations. Below is a **structured outline** that you can use to design a visual diagram or PDF.

## **Visual Diagram Outline**

### **1. CPU Architecture**

```
+-------------------+
| CPU               |
|                   |
| +---------------+ |
| | Control Unit  | |  ← Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.
| +---------------+ |
| | ALU           | |  ← Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
| +---------------+ |
| | Registers     | |  ← Store temporary data, instructions, and addresses.
| | - General     | |  ← E.g., EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX.
| | - Special     | |  ← E.g., PC, IR, SP, Flags.
| +---------------+ |
| | Cache Memory  | |  ← Stores frequently accessed data and instructions.
| | - L1 Cache    | |  ← Inside each core, fastest.
| | - L2 Cache    | |  ← Outside cores but inside CPU.
| | - L3 Cache    | |  ← Shared among all cores.
| +---------------+ |
| | Memory        | |  ← Manages communication with RAM.
| | Controller    | |
| +---------------+ |
+-------------------+
```

### **2. Memory Hierarchy**

```
+-------------------+
| CPU Registers     |  ← Fastest, smallest (e.g., PC, R1, R2).
+-------------------+
| L1 Cache          |  ← Very fast, small (stores frequently used data/instructions).
+-------------------+
| L2 Cache          |  ← Slower than L1, larger.
+-------------------+
| L3 Cache          |  ← Shared among CPU cores, slower than L2.
+-------------------+
| RAM (Main Memory) |  ← Larger, slower than cache (stores program code/data).
+-------------------+
| Secondary Storage |  ← Largest, slowest (HDD/SSD, stores program files).
+-------------------+
```

---

### **3. Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**

```
+-------------------+
| Fetch             |  ← CPU fetches instruction from RAM (address in PC).
+-------------------+
| Decode            |  ← CPU decodes the instruction (e.g., MOV R1, 5).
+-------------------+
| Execute           |  ← CPU performs the operation (e.g., load 5 into R1).
+-------------------+
| Writeback         |  ← CPU stores the result (e.g., update R1).
+-------------------+
```

---

### **4. Buses Inside and Outside the CPU**

#### **Internal Buses (Inside the CPU)**

```
+-------------------+
| Control Unit (CU) |  ↔ Internal Data Bus ↔ ALU
|                   |  ↔ Internal Address Bus ↔ Registers
|                   |  ↔ Internal Control Bus ↔ Cache
+-------------------+
```

#### **External Buses (Outside the CPU)**

```
CPU ↔ System Bus ↔ Northbridge ↔ RAM
CPU ↔ I/O Bus ↔ USB, PCI, SATA
CPU ↔ Memory Bus ↔ RAM
CPU ↔ Expansion Bus ↔ PCIe, Graphics Card
```

---

### **5. Program Execution Flow**

```
+-------------------+
| Secondary Storage |  ← Program stored on HDD/SSD.
+-------------------+
| RAM (Main Memory) |  ← Program loaded into RAM.
+-------------------+
| CPU               |  ← Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.
| - Registers       |  ← Store temporary data.
| - Cache Memory    |  ← Stores frequently accessed data/instructions.
| - Memory Controller| ← Manages communication with RAM.
+-------------------+
```

---

### **6. Cache Memory Hierarchy**

```
CPU Core 1
+-------------------+
| L1 Instruction    |  ← L1 Cache (inside each core).
| L1 Data           |
+-------------------+
| L2 Cache          |  ← L2 Cache (outside the core but inside the CPU).
+-------------------+

CPU Core 2
+-------------------+
| L1 Instruction    |
| L1 Data           |
+-------------------+
| L2 Cache          |
+-------------------+

Shared L3 Cache     ← L3 Cache (shared among all cores).
```

---

### **7. Environment Variables**

```
+-------------------+
| Operating System  |  ← Manages environment variables.
| - Windows         |  ← Set via GUI or `set` command.
| - Linux/macOS     |  ← Set via `export` command or shell config files.
+-------------------+
| Program           |  ← Accesses environment variables during execution.
+-------------------+
```

---

### **8. Page Fault Handling**

```
+-------------------+
| CPU               |  ← Detects page fault (data/instruction not in RAM).
+-------------------+
| Operating System  |  ← Loads missing page from secondary storage into RAM.
+-------------------+
| Secondary Storage |  ← Provides the missing page (e.g., HDD/SSD).
+-------------------+
```

### **9. How to Create the Diagram**

1. Use a **diagramming tool** like:
   - **Microsoft PowerPoint** or **Word**
   - **Google Slides** or **Drawings**
   - **Lucidchart**
   - **Draw.io**
   - **Canva**
2. Copy the **textual representations** above into the tool.
3. Use **shapes**, **arrows**, and **labels** to create a visual flow.
4. Export the diagram as a **PDF** or image.

---

### **10. Example Tools for Creating Diagrams**

- **Lucidchart**: Great for flowcharts and hierarchical diagrams.
- **Draw.io**: Free and easy-to-use tool for creating diagrams.
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: Use shapes and connectors to create diagrams.
- **Canva**: User-friendly tool for creating visual content.
