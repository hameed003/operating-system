**Q1**: Suppose I have a **C program** to **add two numbers**, tell me how this program will be executed by our machine, explain in detail from scratch each and everything with proper examples. [Ans-1]()

**Q2**: is **memory unit ( MU )** a part of **CPU** or something else. [Ans-2]()

**Q3**: what is **Program Counter ( PC )** and where they are actually present, and how they work. explain in detail with example. [Ans-3]()

**Q4**: is it necessary that the **instructions address** will always point in the **RAM memory** or it may change, what actually is the flow of memory lookup to points **instructions adress** to the memory unit like `cache`, `L1`, `L2` , `L3` etc. [Ans-4]()

**Q5**: can a **Program Counter ( PC )** point to an **instruction address** which is not loaded in the RAM yet and it's present in **Secondary Storage** like `HDD` or `SSD`. [Ans-5]()

**Q6**: what is **Page** and **Page Table** in **RAM**? [Ans-6]()

**Q7**: how the **instructions addresses** are stored in `RAM` and how many **instruction** can be stored in `RAM` at a time. [Ans-7]()

**Q8**: what are the things that are Loaded in the **RAM** as the system is `turned on` and running continously until the system is `turned off`. [Ans-8]

**Q9**: Explain the functions of the components that a **CPU/Processor** contains like **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**, **CU (Control Unit)** and **Registers**. does they further contains any other componets. if yes then exlplain there functions as well. [Ans-9]()

**Q10**: can you give a **visual representation** of all the steps involved to run a program right from begining to end. like how the program is loaded in the **RAM** from the secodary memory and how the **CPU** communicates with all the memory unit to run a pragram. give robust visual representation of all these. [Ans-10]()

**Q11**: the **CPU** components you mentioned in that you mentioned register component so does it present inside CU or ALU or it's present independently like CU and ALU. [Ans-11]()

**Q12**: what is the difference between the busses present inside the CPU and busses present outside the CPU name and explain them as well. [Ans-12]()

**Q13**: is 'memory controller' present inside the CPU. [Ans-13]()

**Q14**: but you told CPU only contains CU , ALU and Registers. [Ans-14]()

**Q15**: Will memory controller only controls data fetch from RAM or it also helps to fetch instructions and does it only control the communication between CPU and RAM or other storage components like registers, cache L1, L2, L3 and secondary storage. [Ans-15]()

**Q16**: does cache controller are physically present by like memory controller in CPU. [Ans-16]()

**Q17**: you mentioned about 'cache memory' where does it actually present and is it different from L1, L2, L3 or they are same and where actually the L1, L2 and L3 are located. [Ans-17]()

**Q18**: does 'cache memory, refers to L1, L2 and L3 and there is no separate cache memory present inside CPU. [Ans-18]()

**Q19**: can you draw a visual diagram of pdf to demonstrate all these concepts that I have asked till now. [Ans-19]()

**Q20**: what is the difference between L2 and L3 cache since they both are outside the individual core. [Ans-20]()

**Q21**: what is \*86 instructions architecture. [Ans-21]()
