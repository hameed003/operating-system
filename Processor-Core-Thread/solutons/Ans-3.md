No, **2 logical cores and 2 threads are not the same**, but they are related.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Logical Cores:**

- A **logical core** is what the **operating system sees** as a processor.
- If a CPU has **Hyper-Threading (HT)**, each **physical core** appears as **two logical cores**.
- Example: A **4-core CPU with HT** will show **8 logical cores** in Task Manager.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Threads:**

- A **thread** is a sequence of instructions that a CPU executes.
- If a CPU supports **2 threads per core**, then it can handle **2 tasks at once per core**.
- Example: A **quad-core CPU with HT** will have **8 threads** (each core handling 2 threads).

### **Comparison:**

| Term             | Meaning                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logical Core** | Virtual core seen by OS (created via Hyper-Threading) |
| **Thread**       | A unit of execution handled by a core                 |

If a CPU has **Hyper-Threading (HT)** enabled:  
‚úÖ **1 Physical Core = 2 Logical Cores = 2 Threads**

So, **"2 logical cores" means 2 virtual cores, while "2 threads" means 2 tasks being executed**.

Let me know if you need more clarity! üòä

# Doubt:

that means `threads` are not already present in the `core` but they are created once a software or application are run/executed. [Ans-4](https://github.com/hameed003/operating-system/blob/main/Processor-Core-Thread/solutons/Ans-4.md)
