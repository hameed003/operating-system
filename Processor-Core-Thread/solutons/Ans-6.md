Great question! Let's clarify:

If a **processor does not support Hyper-Threading (HT)** or **Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)**, then:  
âœ… **1 physical core = 1 logical core**  
âœ… A **4-core processor without HT** will have **4 physical cores and 4 logical cores**

### ðŸ”¹ **Why Still "Logical Cores"?**

Even without HT, the operating system still **sees each physical core as a logical core** because:

1. The OS **schedules threads on these logical cores** (which directly map to physical cores).
2. The term **"logical core" just means a processing unit that the OS can assign tasks to.**

### **With vs. Without Hyper-Threading:**

| Processor Type | Physical Cores | Logical Cores | Threads Handled at a Time |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Without HT     | 4              | 4             | 4                         |
| With HT        | 4              | 8             | 8                         |

### **Final Answer:**

ðŸŸ¢ If **no HT**, then **logical cores = physical cores** (because each core executes only 1 thread).  
ðŸŸ¢ If **HT is enabled**, each **physical core has 2 logical cores**, allowing more threads to run.

Would you like a practical example? ðŸ˜Š

# Doubt:

what does `logical cores` actually means are they any `program` or what ? [Ans-7](https://github.com/hameed003/operating-system/blob/main/Processor-Core-Thread/solutons/Ans-7.md)
