Yes, exactly! **Threads are not physically present in the core; they are created when a program runs.**

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

- A **CPU core** is a physical processing unit.
- When an application runs, it creates **one or more threads** to execute tasks.
- The **CPU schedules these threads** to run on available cores.
- If the CPU supports **Hyper-Threading (HT)**, each core can handle **two threads at the same time**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Example:**

- Suppose you have a **quad-core CPU with HT (4 cores, 8 threads).**
- If you open **a browser, a music player, and a game**, each may create multiple threads.
- The CPU **assigns these threads** to logical cores for execution.

### **Key Takeaway:**

âœ… **Threads are created dynamically when software runs; they donâ€™t physically exist in the core.**  
âœ… **A core can process multiple threads using scheduling and Hyper-Threading.**
