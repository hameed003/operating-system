Great question! **Logical cores are not programs or separate physical components**‚Äîthey are **virtual processing units** created by the CPU's design.

### üîπ **What is a Logical Core?**

A **logical core** is a processing unit that the **operating system sees** and assigns tasks (threads) to.

- If a processor **does not support Hyper-Threading (HT)**:  
  ‚úÖ **Logical cores = Physical cores** (because each core runs one thread at a time).
- If a processor **supports HT**:  
  ‚úÖ Each **physical core is split into 2 logical cores**, allowing **2 threads to run at once**.

### üîπ **Are Logical Cores Software or Hardware?**

‚ùå **They are not software or programs.**  
‚úÖ **They are a hardware feature managed by the CPU architecture.**  
‚úÖ They allow better **utilization of CPU resources**, improving multitasking and performance.

### **Example:**

A **4-core CPU with HT** has **8 logical cores**, meaning the OS treats it as an **8-core CPU** for scheduling tasks.

Would you like a deeper technical breakdown? üòä

# Doubt:

is it similar to `virtualization of hardware resources` like we use `Vmware` and `virtaul box` to create multiple `OS` machine. [Ans-8](https://github.com/hameed003/operating-system/blob/main/Processor-Core-Thread/solutons/Ans-8.md)
