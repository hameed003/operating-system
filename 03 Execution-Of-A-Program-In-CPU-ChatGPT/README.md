**Q1**: Suppose I have a **C program** to add two numbers, tell me how this program will be executed by our machine, explain in detail from scratch each and everything with proper examples.[Ans-1]()

**Q2**: Explain in detail what happens once our program is loaded into the **RAM** and how the **MU**, **CU** and **ALU** actually perform the action, tell me in depth[Ans-2]()

**Q3**: What is **Program Counter ( PC )** and where it is present and what does `eax` and `ebx` actually here means . [Ans-3]()

**Q4**: But our **CU** Fetches instructions from **MU** so how the **Program Counter** works explain again. [Ans-4]()

**Q5**: Ok so you say that **Program Counter PC** stores the **address** of **next instructions** which is present in **RAM** and **CU** reads **Program Counter ( PC's )** value and **fetches instruction** from **MU**, i.e **RAM** in this case.[Ans-5]()

**Q6**: Why you written **RAM** in parantheces in front of **MU** here **The `CU` reads the `PC's` value and requests the instruction from the MU (RAM).** Does **MU** and **RAM** are same thing [Ans-6]()

**Q7**: But **MU** is part of **CPU** and is an independent piece so how **RAM** can be inside the **MU**. I am confused.[Ans-7]()

**Q8**: Is **MU** a seperate module like **RAM** or what and where actually it is present. [Ans-8]()

**Q9**: So can I say **CPU** only contains two part **CU** and **ALU**. [Ans-9]()

**Q10**: Since you said the **Program Counter ( PC )** stores **instructions address**, So suppose a program just loaded into the **RAM** so how **PC** can store the **instructions address** even though the connection is not established between **CU** and **RAM** yet. [Ans-10]()

**Q11**: Does the **Prohram Counter ( PC's )** first **instructions address** is always same. [Ans-11]()

**Q12**: Can we see the **instructions address**? [Ans-12]()
