Yes, exactly! The **Program Counter (PC)** stores the **memory address of the next instruction** that is present in **RAM**. The **Control Unit (CU) reads the PC's value** and sends it to the **Memory Unit (MU)**, which then loads the instruction from RAM into the **Instruction Register (IR)** for execution.

## **Step-by-Step Breakdown of How PC, CU, and MU Work Together**

### **1. Fetch Phase (Getting the Next Instruction from RAM)**

- The **PC holds the memory address** of the instruction to be executed.
- The **CU reads the PC's value** and requests the instruction from the **MU (RAM)**.
- The **MU loads the instruction** from that memory location and sends it to the **Instruction Register (IR)**.
- The **PC is updated** to point to the next instruction.

**Example:**

```
PC = 1000h  (Holds address of next instruction)
CU reads PC and requests MU for instruction at 1000h
MU loads instruction (e.g., MOV EAX, 5) into IR
PC increments to 1004h (next instruction address)
```

---

### **2. Decode Phase (CU Interprets the Instruction)**

- The **CU reads the instruction in the IR**.
- It **decodes** the operation (e.g., MOV, ADD, JMP).
- It **determines what needs to be done** and which components (ALU, registers, etc.) should be used.

**Example:**

```
IR contains MOV EAX, 5
CU decodes: Move 5 into the EAX register
```

---

### **3. Execute Phase (Performing the Operation)**

- The **CU signals the ALU or registers** to execute the instruction.
- If it’s an arithmetic operation, the **ALU performs the computation**.
- If it’s a memory operation, the **MU may be accessed again**.
- The **PC is now pointing to the next instruction**.

**Example:**

```
EAX ← 5  (Value is stored in register)
PC = 1004h  (Points to next instruction)
```

---

### **4. What Happens if There’s a Jump or Loop?**

- If a **jump (JMP) or function call occurs**, the **PC does NOT increment normally**.
- Instead, the **PC is updated to a different memory address**, skipping or looping back.

**Example (Jump Condition in Assembly):**

```assembly
MOV EAX, 5
CMP EAX, 5
JE 2000h  ; If EAX == 5, jump to address 2000h
```

- If **EAX == 5**, the **PC is updated to 2000h**, skipping intermediate instructions.

---

### **Final Summary**

- **PC stores the next instruction's memory address (located in RAM).**
- **CU reads PC's value and asks MU to fetch the instruction from RAM.**
- **MU loads the instruction into the IR (Instruction Register).**
- **CU decodes and executes the instruction using ALU and registers.**
- **PC updates to the next instruction or jumps to a different location in case of loops.**
