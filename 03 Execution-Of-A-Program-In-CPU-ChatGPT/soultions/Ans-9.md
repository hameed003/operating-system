Not exactly! The CPU consists of **three main parts**, not just two.

### **Three Main Parts of the CPU**

1. **Control Unit (CU)** – Manages instruction execution, directs data flow.
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
3. **Registers** – Small, fast memory inside the CPU for temporary data storage.

### **Why Are Registers Important?**

Registers are **crucial** because they store:

- The **Program Counter (PC)** – Stores the address of the next instruction.
- The **Instruction Register (IR)** – Holds the current instruction.
- General-purpose registers like **EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX** – Hold temporary data for processing.

Registers are **inside** the CPU and are much faster than RAM or cache.

### **Final Answer**

So, **the CPU contains CU, ALU, and Registers**.

- **CU + ALU** are the processing units.
- **Registers** store data for fast access.
