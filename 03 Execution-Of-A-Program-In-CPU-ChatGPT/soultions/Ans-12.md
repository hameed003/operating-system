Yes, you can **view the memory address** of instructions in a program, but how you do that depends on the environment and tools you're using. Here's a breakdown of how to access instruction addresses:

---

### **1. In Assembly Language**

When programming in **assembly**, you can see the memory addresses of instructions because assembly is closely tied to machine code. Each instruction is placed in memory at a specific address.

- You can use **debugging tools** (like `gdb` for C programs) to inspect memory addresses.
- In assembly, you can directly manipulate memory addresses using labels and directives.

**Example**:

```asm
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; This instruction starts at address 0x1000
    mov eax, 1

    ; Next instruction
    add eax, 2
```

### **2. Using Debuggers (gdb)**

For high-level languages (like C/C++), you can use a **debugger** (e.g., `gdb`) to see the memory addresses where instructions are stored.

#### Steps to view instruction addresses using `gdb`:

1. **Compile the program with debugging symbols** (so you can see addresses):
   ```bash
   gcc -g my_program.c -o my_program
   ```
2. **Start gdb**:
   ```bash
   gdb ./my_program
   ```
3. **Set a breakpoint** to pause execution:
   ```bash
   break main
   ```
4. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   run
   ```
5. **Use the `disas` (disassemble) command** to see the instruction addresses:
   ```bash
   disas
   ```

This will display the assembly instructions along with their memory addresses.

### **3. Using a Hex Editor**

You can open a **compiled binary** (e.g., an executable file) in a **hex editor** to see the raw bytes that make up the program. The **memory addresses** will be visible along with the instructions.

**Steps**:

- Open the executable file in a hex editor (like **Hex Fiend** on macOS, or **HxD** on Windows).
- The left side will show memory addresses, and the right side will show the corresponding instructions (in hexadecimal format).

---

### **4. Using Operating System Tools**

In Linux, you can use tools like **`pmap`** or **`top`** to view memory mappings of running processes.

For example:

- **`pmap`** shows the memory map of a process, which includes the addresses where code and data are loaded.

Example:

```bash
pmap <pid>
```

This will show memory regions, including the code segment (text section) where your program's instructions are loaded.

---

### **5. Compiler/Linker Map Files**

When you compile your program, the **linker** creates a **map file** that lists all memory addresses and symbols in the program.

- You can ask your compiler to generate a map file:
  ```bash
  gcc -Xlinker -Map=program.map my_program.c
  ```
- Open the `program.map` file to view the memory addresses of variables and functions.

---

### **Final Answer**

Yes, you can view the **memory address of instructions** using debugging tools like `gdb`, hex editors, or by inspecting compiler/linker map files. These tools allow you to see where each instruction is located in memory.
